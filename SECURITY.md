Hello, I could not comment on your issue "https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/16038" as it's been closed, so I had to resort to this methode of communication.

I would have you know that I read your comment on that issue, specifically the portion "i was a bee's dick away " and furthermore "(An Australian unit of measure, very precise)" and laughed my ass out,
I also shared it with a friend, and we both laughed our asses out. 

Your comment was too magnificent, I had to let you know.

have a nice day
